					# Implicits Inspected and Explained

					ScalaDays 2016 New York

					<!-- At the keynote at Scala Exchange Jessica Kerr mentioned that there is very much documentation for starting and expert Scala developers, but (almost) nothing in between. In this talk I want to demystify implicits.
Implicits are a fairly advanced feature and a very important aspect of the Scala language. They help with writing concise code and enable lots of DSLs. On the other side they can be very magical for an untrained eye. In this talk we will delve into idiomatic use cases of implicits and how the Scala compiler resolves them. If time allows we will jump into type classes as well. -->

					http://blog.timmybankers.nl

					Outline: Introduction - Implicits - Resolving - Type Classes - Wrap up <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

					Note:
					- Welcome!
					- Many Scala users see implicits everywhere, but their exact use remains a bit magic
					- Goal of talk is to give you an intuition on how implicits work and where to look when things go haywire.
					- Target audience is Scala developers, who already know the language and syntax
					- We already heard a lot about implicits. Martin emphasised the importance of implicits for the Scala Language in the keynore. Yesterday a lot of the talks in the advanced track used and abused implicits a lot.
					- Outline: Context, Implicits, Scoping, Typeclasses

						## Implicits
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### What?

						- Use values without explicit reference
						- OO: _is a_ + _has a_
						- Implicits add: _is viewable as a_
						- Loose Coupling, Tight Cohesion

						Note:
						- _is a_: extends: Cow is an Animal
						- _has a_: members: Animal has a name
						- Cow is viewable as a Mammal
						- Enables: Small core interfaces + rich views

						Implicits enable you to use values without explicitly referencing them. This enables you to write less code, and let implicits do the heavy lifting for you. We will see how this can be useful.
						If we look at Object Orientation, traditionally we see _is a_ and _has a_, respectively 'a Cow _is an_ Animal' and 'an Animal has a name' as field for example. Implicits enable _is viewable as a_ on top of this. This means we can convert values to other more rich values implicitly. This enables small and clean core interfaces and rich views on top of this, resulting in Loose Coupling, but Tight Cohesion.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Examples

						- Akka

						```scala
						trait ScalaActorRef
							def !(message: Any)(implicit sender: ActorRef = Actor.noSender): Unit = ...
						}```
						```scala
						actorRef ! SomeMessage("text")
						```

						- Futures

						```scala
						object Future {
							def apply[T](body: =>T)(implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Future[T] = ...
						}```
						```scala
						Future {
							doExpensiveComputation()
						}
						```

						Note:
						- implicit to pass in sender from actor context
						- `ExectutionContext` to handle the thread management

						Let's look at some examples.
						In Akka when sending a message the tell (bang) is implemented with an implicit parameter `sender`. This enables us to send message to other actors without having to pass in itself in as the sender explicitly.
						Another example is the implicit `ExecutionContext` when using `Future`s. `ExecutionContext` takes care of all the handing of the threads used by Futures under the hood. The implicit allows you to select a runtime for this once and use it implicitly for all the applicable `Future`s. The interface also allows you pass in another thread handling mechanism explicitly.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Examples (2)

						- Collections

						```scala
						trait TraversableOnce[+A] {
							def sum[B >: A](implicit num: Numeric[B]): B = ...
						}```
						```scala
						List(1,2,3).sum
						res0: Int = 6
						```

						Note:
						- `Numeric` type class to allow sum on things that can be added

						It is also used in the Scala collections library. For example you can use `sum` on any `TraversableOnce` if there is an implicit available which makes sure we can do `plus` on the elements of the collection. This is an example of a type class.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Examples (3)

						- Finagle

						```scala
						@implicitNotFound("Builder is not fully configured: Cluster: ${HasCluster}, Codec: ${HasCodec},
						                   HostConnectionLimit: ${HasHostConnectionLimit}")
						private[builder] trait ClientConfigEvidence[HasCluster, HasCodec, HasHostConnectionLimit]

						class ClientBuilder[Req, Rep, HasCluster, HasCodec, HasHostConnectionLimit] private[finagle](...) {
						  def build()(
						    implicit THE_BUILDER_IS_NOT_FULLY_SPECIFIED_SEE_ClientBuilder_DOCUMENTATION:
						    ClientConfigEvidence[HasCluster, HasCodec, HasHostConnectionLimit]
						    ): Service[Req, Rep] = ...
						}```
						```scala
						val builder: ClientBuilder[Request, Response, Yes, Yes, Nothing] =
						  ClientBuilder()
							  .codec(Http())
							  .hosts("twitter.com:80")

						builder.build()
						```

						```
						Error:(24, 15) Builder is not fully configured: Cluster: com.twitter.finagle.builder.ClientConfig.Yes,
						  Codec: com.twitter.finagle.builder.ClientConfig.Yes, HostConnectionLimit: Nothing
builder.build()
             ^```

						Note:
						- `Numeric` type class to allow sum on things that can be added
						- Builder only allows build() when all the configuration has been done
						- `@implicitNotFound` custom error message when Implicit was not found.

						This example is a bit more involved. Finagle provides a type safe builder class, which only builds if all the required settings are configured. The `build()` method can only be called when an implicit value is available which proofs that all settings are configured. If we construct a partially configured builder and try to `build()` it, we will get a compile time error. The annotation `@implicitNotFound` provides us with a custom error message when the implicit can not be found.

							### Implicits enable

							- DSLs
							- Type evidence
							- Reduce verbosity
							- Type classes
							- Dependency Injection at Compile time
							- Extending libraries

							Note:
							- Some examples, but there is more
							- DSLs: reuse standard Scala types and collections by extending them with your library functions
							- Type evidence can help with creating more type safe interfaces, i.e. in Builders, constraint evidence
							- Pass in dependencies depending on which implicit is in scope, used in Play &amp; Slick
							- Less writing, more implicit

							I hope these examples have convinced you of the power of implicits. Implicits allow for a lot more. They can be used to extend types, including all the types in the standard library, allowing for powerful DSLs to be created embedded in the language.
							They can provide type evidence as we saw in the Finagle builder and also in the `TraversableOnce.sum` example where a `Numeric[B]` had to be available.
							They allow us to write less by leaving ceremony out, and thus reduce verbosity.
							Implits enable us to create type classes in Scala, which add features for generic programming and extending of libraries.
							We can do dependency injection by having different implicits in scope and this is all resolved at compile time.
							And we can extend libraries or code that is out of our control.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
							### But beware

							- Resolution rules can be difficult
							- Automatic conversions
							- Do not overuse

							Note:
							- Powerful, but can be magical in grasping, IDE support is really handy here
							- Simple lexical examination not always enough
							- Be careful with conversions, implicits can help, also when being explicit
								+ Semantics can be different (`List` to `Stream` or `Double` to `Int`)
							- If you do find yourself using implicits, always ask yourself if there is a way to achieve the same thing without their help. Principle of least power - Li Haoyi - which Martin referenced in the keynote

							But take care. Implicits are a powerful extensions but being less explicit can become more magical. It is not always clear which method or field is being called just by looking at the code. Fortunately IDE's can help here.
							Also, if values can be converted to values of other types, this can be triggered without you as developer even noticing and can result in doing to much work or possibly worse, automatic translations between types with different semantics, a List to a Stream for example.
							If you can achieve your goal without implicits do not use them.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Demo

						- Implicit conversions (a.k.a. Implicit views)
							```scala
							implicit def a2B(a : A) : B = ...```
						- Implicit parameters
							```scala
							def method(implicit x : Int) = ...```
						- Implicit classes
							```scala
							implicit class X(y: Int)```
						- Implicit declarations
							```scala
							implicit val x = ...```


						Note:
						- Explain how REPLesent works (`r` and `n`)
						- `ImplicitParameter.sc`
						- `ImplicitConversion.sc`
						- `ImplicitClass.sc`
						- Explain about IDE support
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Scoping
						#### Odersky Explains

						Lookup precedence:
						1. By name only, without any prefix
						2. In "implicit scope":
							- companion/package object of
								+ the source type
								+ its parameters + supertype and supertraits

						Note:
						1. Visible as locals/members of enclosing classes and packages or as imports
						2. companion objects that bear some relation to the type
						- the importance is to be as general as possible without reverting to whole program analysis like Haskell does).
						- This is so that library developers can provide sensible defaults in Companion Objects and Package Objects and users can override those by importing or defining implicits in local scope
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Demo

						+ Scoping and resolving

						Note:
						- First show `scoping` package
						- `Scoping.sc`
					</section>
					<!-- <section data-markdown>
						### Outline

						- Manifestations of Implicits
							+ Implicit conversions -> implicit views
							+ Implicit parameters (http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/StrategicScalaStylePrincipleofLeastPower.html#implicit-method-parameter)
							+ Implicit val/var/defs
							+ Implicit (value) class
						- Use cases + how it works underneath
							+ javap
							+ use intellij to see whats where
								* command + shift + p - see what is used for implicit conversion
								* control + q - see what implicits are in scope for this value
							+ show implicits from predef in scope
						- Well known uses?
							+ `implicitly`
							+ Akka ActorRef
							+ ExecutionContext (futures)
							+ Dependency Injection
							+ Type classes
							+ Circe + Spray JSON etc
							+ Shapeless
							- Scalacheck - Arbitrary?
						- Utilities and tooling support (think of a better name)
						- Type classes
						- Ending

						## Typeclasses
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Typeclass uses

						- Ad-hoc polymorphism
						- Extension of libraries

						```
						trait Numeric[T] extends Ordering[T] {
							def plus(x: T, y: T): T
							def minus(x: T, y: T): T
							def times(x: T, y: T): T
							...
						}
						```

						Note:
						- Term originates from Haskell, because no subtyping, to allow overloading of functions and operators
						- Extending library without changing library code, loose coupling
							+ Examples: Comparability, printability, summing
							+ Type class captures common sets of operations
						- Example sort a collection if elements of collection are comparable
							+ Can be done by inheritance, interface etc
							+ But, static and only when writing the element type
							+ Basically extend the library
						- Can be implemented in Scala using implicits

					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Demo

						Typeclass for JSON Serialisation
						- Naive with subtyping
						- Typeclass + improvements

						Note:
						- Adding JSonSerialisable everywhere will clutter your implemetation => High Coupling
						- `typeclass/Naive.sc`
						- `typeclass/JsonSerializer.sc`

						### Recap

						- Implicits are powerful
						- Be careful with conversions
						- Implicit precedence: first look local, then in companion/package object
						- Typeclasses to extend libraries

						### Questions? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

						Note:
						- Powerful. Allow to write expressive code.
						- Use cases range from DSLs to extending libraries to full blown DI.
						- Use your IDE to help spot conversions and see which implicits are used
						- Typeclasses, extend in Nonintrusive way, enabling loose coupling
